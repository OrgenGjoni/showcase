# Simple search and view profiles SPA and JSON-Server for mocked data

## Quick Startup
* Start with initializing the project by installing dependencies for our project.

```
npx lerna bootstrap
```

* Start both server and React Application.

```
npm run start
```

Now React Application will be serving on port 3000 meanwhile JSON-Server on port 3001.

***important! Both commands should be run on the hoem directory of the project, so 'showcase/', and please after the window opens on the browser refresh before because the server startup delay may cause data nout being served in the first iteration***
